# USB SFC/SNES Controller

This is code for an ATmega32U4 that converts the SFC/SNES controller
serial protocol to USB HID.  I used a SparkFun Pro Micro as the board.
The prototype fits (barely) inside the controller itself and replaces
the normal cable with a USB cable.

This was my first attempt at microcontroller programming.  Nothing
much to see here yet.

# USB SFC/SNES and Saturn Controller

This is code for an ATmega32U4 that converts the SFC/SNES or Sega
Saturn controller protocols to USB HID.  I fit the microcontroller
board inside the controller shells and replaced the cords with
ordinary USB-A to micro-USB-B cables.  An Arduino Micro or same-sized
clone will work.

This was my first attempt at microcontroller programming.  In the
interest of learning, everything was done by hand from specs instead
of leveraging the Arduino environment or existing libraries.
